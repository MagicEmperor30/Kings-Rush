# Kings Rush - README

## Game Overview

**Kings Rush** is an endless runner game where players navigate through a physics-based environment, dodging obstacles on a precarious, shaky bridge. The goal of the game is simple: **survive as long as possible** while avoiding dynamically generated challenges, collecting power-ups, and reaching checkpoints to extend gameplay.

The game leverages **procedural generation** to create unpredictable and exciting obstacles, ensuring no two runs are the same. With a focus on **rigid body physics** and Unity’s built-in physics engine, players will need to rely on quick reflexes and adaptability to overcome a variety of dangers.

## Key Features

- **Procedurally Generated Levels:** The game continuously generates unique obstacles and hazards, ensuring each run is a fresh experience.
  
- **Physics-Based Gameplay:** Realistic physics, including interactions with various obstacles (e.g., tripping over or colliding with objects), will create dynamic gameplay.
  
- **Power-Ups and Checkpoints:** Collect power-ups to speed up your character or unlock checkpoints, giving you more time to survive and increase your score.
  
- **Endless Run Mode:** Keep running as long as you can! The longer you last, the higher your score.

- **Challenging Obstacles:** Dodge physics-based objects that may fall, shift, or move unpredictably.

## Development Focus

In this project, we’ll explore and deepen our understanding of core Unity development concepts and C# programming techniques, including:

- **Procedural Level Generation:** Learning to create dynamic, ever-changing levels that keep players on their toes.
  
- **Rigid Body Physics:** Utilizing Unity’s physics engine, including physics materials, collision handling, and interactions with different objects.
  
- **Animator Transitions:** Creating smooth animations for the player character, such as running and tripping when obstacles are hit.

- **Inspector Attributes:** Using attributes like tooltips and headers in the Unity Inspector to improve the development workflow.

- **Advanced C# Techniques:** You'll gain experience with programming concepts such as:
  - **Lists**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Dependency Injection**
  - **New Unity methods and keywords** relevant to game mechanics and procedural generation.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Game Engine** (for 3D game development, procedural generation, and physics simulation)
- **C#** (for scripting and gameplay logic)
- **Unity Physics Engine** (for realistic physics and collisions)

## Getting Started

To get started with **Kings Rush**, clone or download the repository, open it in Unity, and start the game directly from the editor. The project is structured to allow you to dive into the gameplay mechanics, and modify or extend the systems as needed.

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2023 or later
- Basic knowledge of Unity Editor and C# programming

### How to Play

1. **Start the game** and control your character to begin running.
2. **Dodge obstacles** such as falling objects or shifting bridges.
3. Collect **power-ups** to increase your speed or unlock checkpoints.
4. Survive as long as possible to rack up a high score!

### Controls

- **W, A, S, D** or **Arrow keys** to move the player.s
